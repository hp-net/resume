## Development

### Locally

Before you start make sure you have *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll* installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

1. Fork and or clone this repository locally
2. `cd resume`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser. To find out more about *Jekyll* take a look [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

***Note:** You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`.*
