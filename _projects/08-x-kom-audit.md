Conducted an IT **audit** of X-Kom's architecture, divided into two main phases: **AS-IS** and **TO-BE**.

**AS-IS Phase**

This phase involved analyzing the current state of X-Kom's architecture. The process included:

- Reviewing **100+ documents** of existing documentation.
- Preparing an anonymous **questionnaire** with more than 70 questions, gathering over 100
  responses.
- Conducting 20+ **workshops** over 30 days, covering almost all X-Kom systems. Additional workshops
  were held with business, configuration, and infrastructure teams.

The outcomes of this phase included:

- Modeling the current architecture using the **C4 Model**.
- Delivering a report with system **ratings** across four areas: elasticity, scalability, and
  reliability.
- Creating a **System Model Canvas** (based on the Business Model Canvas) for each system.
- Developing a **heatmap** of system ratings.

**TO-BE Phase**

Focused on defining the future architecture landscape, this phase involved:

- Conducting workshops with business, IT, and security teams.
- Preparing a **Technical Debt Report**.
- Creating a future architecture vision using the **C4 Model**.
- Proposing detailed recommendations and a **roadmap** for implementation.

I was an **IT Expert** in this project, working as part of a team alongside a Business Architect and
a Senior Architect.
