IT **audit** of X-Kom architecture divided into two parts: AS-IS and TO-BE.

In AS-IS started with existing documentation analysis, we read 100+ documents. Next, we have prepared 
anonymous **questionnaire** with more than 70 questions. We have got more than one hundred answers. Then we have series
of **workshops** (20+). And during 30 days we talked about almost every X-Kom system. We also have additional workshops with
business, configuration and infrastructure teams. The result of this phase was current architecture in C4 model and a report
with **rating** for each system in 4 areas: elasticity, scalability, reliability. We have also created **System Model Canvas** (based on Business Model Canvas)
for each system and ratings heatmap.

During To-BE we focused on creating a future vision on architecture landscape. Based on workshops
with business, it and security we have prepared:
- technical debt report,
- future architecture vision in C4 model,
- recommendations with roadmap.
