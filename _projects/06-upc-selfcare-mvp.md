Developed a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** self-service platform for UPC clients, marking the start
of UPC's digital transformation initiative known as **DNA (Digital and Agile)**.

Collaborated with UX specialists and analysts to identify client needs and problems, creating a *
*Customer Journey Map** and defining the MVP scope. In just **10 weeks** (10 one-week sprints), the
MVP was implemented and released to production. Key features included login functionality,
onboarding, payment list and details, online payments, notifications, and customer profile
management.

In an additional 4 weeks, a chatbot was integrated with a custom UI, rules, and knowledge base from
Stanusch.

The success of this project led to the expansion of digital transformation within UPC, scaling one
team into three additional teams provided by UPC.

I served as the **IT Architect**, **Developer**, and **Team Leader** for this project.
