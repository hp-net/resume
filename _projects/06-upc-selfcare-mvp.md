PWA (Progressive Web App) **selfservice** for UPC clients.

Project was beginning of digital transformation in UPC called DNA (Digital And Agile). Together with UX specialists and analysts we started 
with exploring clients problems and needs. We have created a Customer Journey Map and scope of MVP. After that
in **only 10 weeks** (10 one-week sprints) we implemented it and released to production. MVP consists of login functionality, onboarding, 
payments list and additional payment information, online payments, notifications, customer profile. In the next 4 weeks we added
chatbot functionality with custom UI, custom rules and knowledge provided by Stanusch knowledge base. 

After success of this project, digital transformation in UPC was extended from our one team to 3 more provided by UPC.
