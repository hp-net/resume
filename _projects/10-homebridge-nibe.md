This was my first **open source** project, which has already received some support in the form of
coffee donations from users who appreciated it.

I developed a **Homebridge plugin** that retrieves data from a Nibe heat pump via **Nibe Uplink**.  
Homebridge enables integration with smart home devices that lack native support for Apple HomeKit.

**Technologies & Tools:**

- **TypeScript**
- GitHub
- Gulp
- Jest
- Homebridge
- Node.js, npm
