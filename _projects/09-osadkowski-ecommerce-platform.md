Aim of this project was to create online touchpoints for customers.

We have started with exploring customer needs, company goals and limitations. I prepared a series of workshops for
technology understanding. Then created **Architectural Drivers** for future architecture and System Discovery Canvases (similar to X-Kom).
I also helped with Customer Journey Map and roadmap. 

During deeper analysis of first item from roadmap - eCare - my role was to prepare non-functional requirements, logical architecture
and help with scoping and functional requirements. The result of this work was gathered in **Service Blueprint**.

Next, as a <mark>Team Leader</mark> I was responsible for technical setup before regular sprints start. 

When agile delivery has started, I was supporting scrum team and at the same time defining eCommerce.
Together with Business Architect we have conducted a series of workshops based on **Story Storming**. As a result
we provided high level documentation for eCommerce with recommended software, domains with responsibilities and boundaries,
architecture diagrams, high level requirements and business processes.

My role in this project was <mark>Solution Architect</mark>.
