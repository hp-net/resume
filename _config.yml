          IT **audit** of X-Kom architecture divided into two parts: AS-IS and TO-BE.

          In AS-IS started with existing documentation analysis, we read 100+ documents. Next we have prepared 
          anonymous **questionnaire** with more than 70 questions. We have got more than one hundred answers. Then we have series
          of **workshops** (20+). And during 30 days we talked about almost every X-Kom system. We also have additional workshops with
          business, configuration and infrastructure teams. The result of this phase was current architecture in C4 model and a report
          with **rating** for each system in 4 areas: elasticity, scalability, reliability. We have also created **System Model Canvas** (based on Business Model Canvas)
          for each system and ratings heatmap.
          
          During To-BE we focused on creating a future vision on architecture landscape. Based on a workshops
          with business, it and security we have prepared:
          - technical debt report,
          - future architecture vision in C4 model,
          - recommendations with roadmap.

          PWA (Progressive Web App) **selfservice** for UPC clients.

          Project was beginning of digital transformation in UPC called DNA (Digital And Agile). Together with UX specialists and analysts we started 
          with exploring clients problems and needs. We have created Customer Journey Map and scope of MVP. After that

          payments list and additional payment information, online payments, notifications, customer profile. In next 4 weeks we added
          chatbot functionality with custom ui, custom rules and knowledge provided by Stanusch knowledge base.

            After some time of beeing an expert I decided to go back to my root and work as a team member. Other thing that I wanted to change 
            was to move from “big products” to something smaller and **open source**. That when I have meet and learned **microservices** and **cloud**.

            80% of my time I have spent on projects for Deutsche Telekom, Fortum, UPC, X-Kom and lately Osadkowski.

            Rest of my time I have dedicated for **knowledge sharing** and **learning**.

            I have been very active on company level. I have became **lider of Cloud cricle**. My biggest achivments there were creating course 
            for employyes about microservices and cloud. Convincing, organizing budget and helping with cloud certification on AWS and GCP. 
            I initiated architects meetings. Make some presentations about microservices and projects that I was involed in. I have been also one 
            of the person that created Hycom’s Unified Delivery Methodology. That was a guidline with standards about project realisation from 
            design to delivery.

            I have been involved in few projects with **Technical University of Lodz**. First one Implementacje Przemysłowe was a regular subject 
            from univeristy (Faculty of Technical Physics, Information Technology and Applied Mathematics) in cooperation with Hycom. I have been part 
            of it couple of times. Together with students we where making small projects like Facebook chatbot or Confluence plugin. Other initiative 
            where together with students council (Faculty of Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Control Engineering) we have prepared an on site 
            programming course. Topic of the course was: "Hy!Class: Tworzenie mikroserwisów z wykorzystaniem Spring Cloud oraz Netflix OSS".

            Together with my colleague had a presentation on **"Akademickie Targi Pracy"**. We have talked about TDD and the topic of our presentation was: 
            "Developer nie SAPER, myli się nie raz".

            Next there was workshop for **"Młodzi w Łodzi"** with topic "Hy!Class: Zwinne wytwarzanie oprogramowania". It was interactive workshop where 
            I was teaching students about agile and scrum. Durig the workshop we have played a lot of games like Agile Values Puzzle Game, 
            Marshmallow challenge, Airplains production.

            My last public presentation was on **JUG** (Java User Group) in Toruń where together with my collgue were talking about it architect role. 
            Topic of presentation was "Hy!Class: Co robi architekt?".

            Last but not least I have been also a guardian for few people. I was responisble for their personal development and carier path.

          Next change in my career was to move from development to consultant/expert role.
          
          At the first 6 month I was working full time in Germany/Bonn at Deutsche Telekom headquater. 
          Later I was working partially in Germany/Bonn, partially in Poland/Lodz.
          
          I was working with people from all over the world. Mostly I was involved in 
          creating design guidelines for T-Mobile online stores in Europe based on Oracle ATG. I was also 
          participating in meetings and presentations, researching and documenting application integrations, 
          comparing products and technologies: ATG vs Hybris, Portlets vs. Servlets, etc. In general I was
          Oracle **ATG and integration expert** cooperating with many Deutsche Telekom teams and departments.

          During this time I was working with Oracle ATG, Sitebuilder from Spindrift, Oracle Knowledge, CoreMedia,
          Siebel products.

          I was involved in projects: 
          - eCompany - ATG - Siebel integration POC
          - eGarage - digital transformation project 
          - T-mobile PL (t-mobile.pl) - polish telco store
          - T-mobile NatCo's in Europe - national companies initiatives

        caption: April 2008 - August 2013
        description: | 
            I started my real IT developer journey as a trainee in AMG.net. I was one of the **best students** and during first phase of training I 
            understand what this coding is all about. Second phase of training was work on real project, in my case it was Orange portal.

            After training I’ve stayed in AMG.net. Very fast I was assigned to “Functional Expansions” as projects **technical team leader**. 
            Team was small from 2 to 5 people. It was rather small, recurring projects with changes to small to put them in big release. 
            Usually development took less than couple of days. Together with my colleague we have manage to make this project as a role model for other. 
            We manage to **make it profitable, good documented and well communicated**.

            During that time I was responsible for almost whole delivery process. From design, develop to delivery preparation. 
            My role was to prepare pricing for the change, document, implement, test, merge it and prepare deployment instructions. 
            I was also responsible for maintaining development environment.

            After few years I’ve decided to move to something bigger.

            I’ve stayed in Orange but moved to big releases. I was involved in **eCommerce** part. Most of my responsibilities were 
            the same but on much bigger scale. During that years I was also responsible for **code refactoring, performance optimization, 
            source code quality, third-party audits analysis, big commerce architecture modifications**. From time to time I’ve also helped 
            in other regions of Orange, e.g: nju mobile eShop.

            Apart from Orange I was also very active on company level. I was participating in **offering processes, 
            employee and students trainings**. I was involved in **internal projects** also. I have crated and administrated 
            plugins for Confluence and Crucible from Atlassian stack.
