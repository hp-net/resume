The next change in my career was to move from development to consultant/expert role.

At the first 6 months I was working full time in Germany/Bonn at Deutsche Telekom headquarter. 
Later I was working partially in Germany/Bonn, partially in Poland/Łódź.

I was working with people from all over the world. Mostly I was involved in 
creating design guidelines for T-Mobile online stores in Europe based on Oracle ATG. I was also 
participating in meetings and presentations, researching and documenting application integrations, 
comparing products and technologies: ATG vs Hybris, Portlets vs. Servlets, etc. In general, I was
Oracle **ATG and integration expert** cooperating with many Deutsche Telekom teams and departments.

During this time I was working with Oracle ATG, Sitebuilder from Spindrift, Oracle Knowledge, CoreMedia,
Siebel products.

I was involved in projects: 
- eCompany - ATG - Siebel integration POC
- eGarage - digital transformation project 
- T-mobile PL (t-mobile.pl) - polish telco store
- T-mobile NatCo's in Europe - national companies initiatives
