The next step in my career transitioned me from a development role to a consultant/expert position.

For the first six months, I worked full-time in Germany at Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn.
Subsequently, my role involved splitting time between Bonn, Germany, and Łódź, Poland.

I collaborated with international teams and was primarily responsible for creating design guidelines
for T-Mobile online stores across Europe, leveraging Oracle ATG. My work included participating in
meetings and presentations, conducting application integration research, documenting systems, and
comparing technologies such as ATG vs. Hybris and Portlets vs. Servlets. Overall, I served as an
Oracle **ATG and integration expert**, working closely with various Deutsche Telekom teams and
departments.

During this time, I gained hands-on experience with tools and technologies including Oracle ATG,
Sitebuilder by Spindrift, Oracle Knowledge, CoreMedia, and Siebel products.

Key projects I contributed to include:

- **eCompany** – Proof of concept for ATG and Siebel integration
- **eGarage** – A digital transformation initiative
- **T-mobile PL (t-mobile.pl)** – Polish T-Mobile online store
- **T-Mobile NatCos in Europe** – Initiatives for national companies across Europe
