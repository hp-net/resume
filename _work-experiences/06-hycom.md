After some time in an expert/consultant role, I decided to return to being a team member. I also
wanted to shift my focus from large-scale products to smaller, **open-source** solutions. This is
when I was introduced to **microservices** and **cloud technologies**.

I dedicated 80% of my time to projects for Deutsche Telekom, Fortum, UPC, X-Kom, and more recently,
Osadkowski. The remaining time was focused on **knowledge sharing** and **personal learning**.

On a company level, I was highly active and took on the role of **leader of the Cloud Circle**. My
key contributions included:

- Designing and delivering internal courses on microservices and cloud technologies
- Securing budgets and advocating for cloud certifications (AWS and GCP)
- Initiating architects' meetings and presenting on microservices and various projects
- Contributing to the creation of **Hycom’s Unified Delivery Methodology**, which provided standards
  to guide project realization from design to delivery

Additionally, I collaborated with the **Technical University of Łódź** on multiple initiatives:

- **Implementacje Przemysłowe**: A university subject in collaboration with Hycom, where I worked
  with students on small projects like a Facebook chatbot and a Confluence plugin
- A programming course run with the students' council titled: "Hy!Class: Tworzenie mikroserwisów z
  wykorzystaniem Spring Cloud oraz Netflix OSS"

I also participated in numerous presentations and workshops:

- **"Akademickie Targi Pracy"**: Delivered a presentation titled "Developer nie SAPER, myli się nie
  raz", focusing on TDD, together with a colleague
- **Młodzi w Łodzi**: Conducted an interactive workshop titled "Hy!Class: Zwinne wytwarzanie
  oprogramowania", teaching agile and scrum methodologies through activities such as the Agile
  Values Puzzle Game, the Marshmallow Challenge, and Airplanes production exercises
- **JUG (Java User Group) in Toruń**: Presented with a colleague on the responsibilities of an IT
  architect under the topic "Hy!Class: Co robi architekt?"

Lastly, I served as a mentor/guardian for several employees, helping guide their career paths and
personal development.
