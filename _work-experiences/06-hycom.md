After some time of being an expert, I decided to go back to my root and work as a team member. Other thing that I wanted to change 
was to move from “big products” to something smaller and **open source**. That when I have meet and learned **microservices** and **cloud**.

80% of my time I have spent on projects for Deutsche Telekom, Fortum, UPC, X-Kom and lately Osadkowski.

Rest of my time I have dedicated for **knowledge sharing** and **learning**.

I have been very active on company level. I have become **leader of Cloud circle**. My biggest achievements were creating course 
for employees about microservices and cloud. Convincing, organizing budget and helping with cloud certification on AWS and GCP. 
I initiated architects meetings. Make some presentations about microservices and projects that I was involved in. I have also been one 
of the person that created Hycom’s Unified Delivery Methodology. That was a guideline with standards about project realization from 
design to delivery.

I have been involved in few projects with **Technical University of Lodz**. First one "Implementacje Przemysłowe" was a regular subject 
from university (Faculty of Technical Physics, Information Technology and Applied Mathematics) in cooperation with Hycom. I have been part 
of it a couple of times. Together with students we were making small projects like Facebook chatbot or Confluence plugin. Other initiative 
where together with students council (Faculty of Electrical, Electronic, Computer and Control Engineering) we have prepared an on site 
programming course. The topic of the course was: "Hy!Class: Tworzenie mikroserwisów z wykorzystaniem Spring Cloud oraz Netflix OSS".

Together with my colleague had a presentation on **"Akademickie Targi Pracy"**. We have talked about TDD and the topic of our presentation was: 
"Developer nie SAPER, myli się nie raz".

Next there was workshop for **"Młodzi w Łodzi"** with topic "Hy!Class: Zwinne wytwarzanie oprogramowania". It was an interactive workshop where 
I was teaching students about agile and scrum. During the workshop we have played a lot of games like Agile Values Puzzle Game, 
Marshmallow challenge, Airplanes production.

My last public presentation was on **JUG** (Java User Group) in Toruń where together with my colleague we were talking about it architect role. 
Topic of presentation was "Hy!Class: Co robi architekt?".

Last but not least, I have also been a guardian for a few people. I was responsible for their personal development and career path.
