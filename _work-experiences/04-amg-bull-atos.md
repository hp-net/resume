My IT developer journey began as a trainee at AMG.net, where I was recognized as one of the **top
students**. During the first phase of training, I gained a solid understanding of coding
fundamentals. The second phase involved working on a real-world project—the Orange portal.

Following the training, I continued at AMG.net and was quickly promoted to **Technical Team Leader**
for the “Functional Expansions” projects. Leading a team of 2 to 5 people, I managed smaller,
recurring projects focused on incremental changes, often completed within a few days. Together with
a colleague, we transformed these projects into a **role model for other teams** by making them *
*profitable, well-documented, and effectively communicated**.

In this role, I handled nearly all aspects of the delivery process, including design, development,
and deployment preparation. This involved tasks like preparing pricing, documenting requirements,
implementing changes, testing, merging, and creating deployment instructions. I was also responsible
for maintaining the development environment.

After several years, I decided to take on larger challenges. I remained within Orange but
transitioned to their major release projects, particularly in the **eCommerce** domain. My
responsibilities grew significantly in scale and included **code refactoring, performance
optimization, source code quality improvements, third-party audit analysis, and major commerce
architecture modifications**. Occasionally, I also contributed to other regions of Orange, such as
the nju mobile eShop.

Beyond my project-specific contributions, I was highly active at the company level. I participated
in **offering processes, employee and student training sessions**, and various internal initiatives.
Additionally, I developed and managed plugins for Atlassian tools such as Confluence and Crucible as
part of internal projects.
