I started my real IT developer journey as a trainee in AMG.net. I was one of the **best students** and during the first phase of training I 
understand what this coding is all about. The second phase of training was work on a real project, in my case it was Orange portal.

After training, I’ve stayed in AMG.net. Very fast, I was assigned to “Functional Expansions” as projects **technical team leader**. 
Team was small from 2 to 5 people. It was rather small, recurring projects with changes too small to put them in big release. 
Usually, development took less than a couple of days. Together with my colleague, we have manage to make this project as a role model for others. 
We manage to **make it profitable, good documented and well communicated**.

During that time I was responsible for almost whole delivery process. From design, develop to delivery preparation. 
My role was to prepare pricing for the change, document, implement, test, merge it and prepare deployment instructions. 
I was also responsible for maintaining development environment.

After a few years I’ve decided to move to something bigger.

I’ve stayed in Orange, but moved to big releases. I was involved in **eCommerce** part. Most of my responsibilities were 
the same but on a much bigger scale. During that years I was also responsible for **code refactoring, performance optimization, 
source code quality, third-party audits analysis, big commerce architecture modifications**. From time to time I’ve also helped 
in other regions of Orange, e.g: nju mobile eShop.

Apart from Orange, I was also very active on company level. I was participating in **offering processes, 
employee and students trainings**. I was also involved in **internal projects**. I have crated and administrated 
plugins for Confluence and Crucible from Atlassian stack.
